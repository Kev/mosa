This package provides a (currently incomplete) implementation of the
dominance-based multi-objective simulated annealing algorithm proposed in:

Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing", Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE Congress on
Evolutionary Computation (CEC'04), Portland, Oregon, pp 23-30

Evolutionary Computation, pp forthcoming

as well as an implementation of the set-based multi-objective simulated
annealer proposed in

Compiling 
========= 

This package will require the Trolltech Qt library to compile. It should 
work on all platforms Qt works on, and has been tested on Linux, OS X and 
Windows.

To compile, simply run
qmake
to generate the Makefiles, and then
make
to compile
